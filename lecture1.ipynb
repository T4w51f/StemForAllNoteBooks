    "Python is user-friendly and extremely powerful programming language. Learning to work with it is the best way to enter the\r\n",
    "world of programming. It offers developers toolkits with the power of developing simple games and applications, perform statistical\r\n",
    "analysis, run vector/matrix math, train artificial intelligence, program robots and so much more. For the purpose of this event,\r\n",
    "we will work with Python 3 (preferrably version 3.9). We generally avoid mixing Python 2 and Python 3 due to the huge differences\r\n",
    "in supported features and libraries, which introduced backwards incompatible changes in Python 3, and made several functions obsolete \r\n",
    "in the newer versions.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Before we dive into learning the fundamentals of python, let us quickly talk about commenting our code and display data by running\r\n",
    "our code. This will come extremely handy throughout the rest of this program. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Precise documentation and commenting is highly recommended in the programming world. A developer does not just write code for \r\n",
    "themselves to understand, but for anyone using their code too. It should be clean, readable, and intuitive. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Printing data is important if you want to display any data on the console (console is an interface the user interacts with to run \r\n",
    "a program). This could be used to view results of arithmetic operations, to interact with a user, or to debug your code. Debugging\r\n",
    "simply means resolving issues or bugs in your code by viewing the different state of your data or variables, or by seeing how\r\n",
    "far your code runs before breaking.\r\n",
